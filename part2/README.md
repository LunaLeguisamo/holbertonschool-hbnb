## Description. üìã

HBnB Evolution is a property management application that allows users to add listings and amenities for others to rent and review. The architecture follows a layered design to enhance maintainability and scalability, with three main layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: The graphical interface that lets users interact and make API requests.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Manages core operations and data validation, including the main entities User, Place, Review, and Amenity.
